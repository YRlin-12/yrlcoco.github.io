<h3>Here you shall find project which I love, or Currently involved, or Started by me.</h3><hr>

<b>Note:</b> currently I am more active in github.com hence my projects are currently hosted there. But I also respect alternatives such as gitlab.com and bitbucket.org. While I would like to host these repositories in my own website too (along with a mirror in github, gitlab and bitbucket), but currently I do not own a server to provide such service.

<ul>
  {% for post in site.categories.projects %}
    <li>
      <h2><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h2>
      {{ post.excerpt }}
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
